# Revision Frequency vs Study Hours: An Exploratory Analysis of Student Performance

## Introduction

    Students often assume that studying longer hours guarantees better performance. However, many experience inconsistent results and burnout despite 
    increasing their study duration. This raised an important question: does the frequency of revision contribute more to performance than the total number of study hours? 
    This exploratory study attempts to understand how revision habits and total study hours relate to mock-test performance among senior secondary students.

## Research Question

    Is revision frequency a stronger predictor of mock-test performance than total study hours among senior secondary students?

## Methodology

    Sample size: 19 students
    Classes: 11 and 12
    Streams: PCM and PCB
    Preparation types: self-study, online coaching, offline coaching, mixed
    Data type: ordinal, self-reported
    Analysis: descriptive trend analysis
    Study type: exploratory (non-causal)
    
### Data handling note:

    One survey column ("How many days per week do you revise?") was auto-converted to dates in Excel (e.g., 2026-06-07). These were manually mapped back to 
    the original categories: 0–1 days, 2–3 days, 4–5 days, and 6–7 days.

## Results

### Study Hours vs Mock-Test Performance

    Students studying more than six hours per day appeared across all performance categories. Some high-study respondents still scored in the 40–60% range. 
    This indicates diminishing returns in raw study time.

#### Interpretation
    Longer study hours alone do not consistently translate into higher performance.

### Revision Frequency vs Mock-Test Performance

    Students who revised four to seven days per week were more frequently represented in higher mock-test score categories (60–80% and above).
    Lower revision frequency clusters were found primarily in the below-40% and 40–60% groups.

#### Interpretation
    Revision frequency showed a clearer trend with performance than total study hours.

### Additional Context

    Other factors also appeared to influence performance consistency: 
    
       -->Students sleeping 7–8 hours reported more stable performance.
       -->High self-reported stress correlated with inconsistent scores.
       -->Qualitative responses highlighted discipline, sleep, social media usage, and mental state as important factors.
    
    These observations indicate that performance is multi-factorial and not determined by a single habit or variable.


## Conclusion

    Within this small exploratory sample (n = 19), revision frequency shows a more consistent association with mock-test performance than total study hours. 
    This does not prove that revision is inherently more important, but it suggests that regular reinforcement of previously learned material 
    may offer more reliable performance benefits than increasing total study duration.

## Limitations

    This study has several limitations:
    
       -->Small sample size (n = 19)
       -->Self-reported data may introduce bias and measurement error\
       -->Ordinal variables restrict advanced statistical modeling
       -->Cross-sectional design does not allow causal inference
       -->Sample mostly consists of PCM students, limiting generalizability
    
    A larger and more diverse sample, along with longitudinal data, would be required to validate these trends.

## Reflection

    This project highlighted the challenges of working with real-world data, including issues such as Excel auto-formatting and self-report variability. 
    It also reinforced that academic performance is shaped by multiple interacting factors, and that assumptions such as "more hours equals better results" require 
    careful examination. This study serves as the starting point for deeper research into effective learning strategies.

## Future Work

    Possible extensions of this project include: 
    
       -->A longitudinal study tracking students over several weeks
       -->A bias-focused analysis comparing self-study vs coaching students
       -->An intervention study testing structured revision plans
